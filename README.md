# numerical-analysis

## This repository is created to organize all C++ programs implemented to solve numerical analysis problems.

## 1. Definitions

##### 1.1 Numerical Analysis: It is the branch of mathematics that deals with the tools and methods to solve mathematical problems in numerical form.

##### 1.2 Numerical Algorithm: It is a set of procedures that gives an approximate solution to a mathematical problem.

##### 1.3 Stable Algorithm: It is an algorithm for which the cumulative effect of errors is limited and a useful result is generated.

##### 1.4 Numerical Iteration Method: It is a mathematical procedure that generates a sequence of improving approximate solution for a class of problems i.e. the process of finding successive approximations.

##### 1.5 Algorithm of Iteration Method: It is a specific way of implementation of an iteration method, including the termination criteria.
